# Predicting-Hazardous-NEOs-
In this project, we aimed to predict whether an asteroid is potentially hazardous based on various features such as absolute magnitude, estimated diameter, relative velocity, and miss distance. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we identified important trends and patterns, which provided valuable insights into the distribution of asteroid characteristics. After handling missing data and preprocessing, we addressed the class imbalance of hazardous vs. non-hazardous asteroids using the SMOTE technique to oversample the minority class. We then trained a Random Forest Classifier, which was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC-AUC curve. The model demonstrated balanced performance, with good accuracy in classifying both hazardous and non-hazardous asteroids. Visualization of the ROC-AUC curve and confusion matrix helped highlight the modelâ€™s effectiveness, particularly in reducing false positives and false negatives. Overall, this project showcases the potential of machine learning in improving the detection and classification of hazardous asteroids, contributing to planetary defense initiatives and future research.
